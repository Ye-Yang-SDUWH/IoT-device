# Introduction
This is a prototype of an IOT(Internet of things) device made by single chip microcomputer, which is one of my projects.
The basic function is to collect the data about your sleep and send the data to an APP through blue tooth for further analysis.
The code and the methods about the equipment are shared in this Repository.
